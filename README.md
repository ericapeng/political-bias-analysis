# Political Bias Analysis

With the recent US elections, it is clear that the Republican and Democratic parties are becoming increasingly polarizing. In addition, major news corporations are often heavily biased towards one party or the other. Reading news articles that are heavily biased will rarely provide the full story since negative information will be painted in a more positive light and vice versa. 
The goal of our project was to screen news articles from various news stations and classify them using machine learning based on bias towards a certain party. Given the classifications, we could then recommend specific news stations that are either less biased as a whole, or have equal distributions of positive and negative articles on both parties.
