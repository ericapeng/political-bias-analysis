have inde violat his own recus standard though the unusu issu is by no mean clearcut session who has said he has had no improp contact with the russian conclud after meet with doj ethic lawyer in march i should not be involv in investig a campaign i had a role in so did ag session violat his recus by advis on the decis to fire comey quit possibl although this is a matter of debat it depend on the scope of session recus and whether comey termin relat to the matter he is recus from legal expert tell msnbc stephen giller a nation renown legal ethic expert from new york univers school of law told msnbc that session flat violat the recus the scope of the recus is veri broad ani exist or futur investig of ani matter relat in ani way to the campaign for presid the ground for fire mr comey in the rosenstein memorandum are explicit state to be mr comey public comment about mrs clinton dure the campaign and prior to the elect giller said these ground are plain encompass within mr session descript of the broad scope of his recus he ad a us hous committe solicit giller view on the recus issu and he sent written input to the committe wednesday kathleen clark a legal ethic expert at washington univers school of law was not as conclus but said there is strong evid that the fire was relat to the investig and if session had ani access to ani inform indic that they were relat that the potenti fire was relat to that investig he had an oblig to recus but a former feder prosecutor who request anonym said if session simpli chose to recus himself and was not compel to do so by the doj then he may chang his mind if it selfimpos he can chang his mind if he want said this former prosecutor former feder prosecutor michael wild who teach legal ethic at cardozo critic session but said his role advis about comey fire was not a formal breach he selfrecus himself so there nobodi who can accus him of a breach wild said ad that it would still have been wiser to do the fire without session involv former us attorney joyc vanc did not say session flat violat his recus but that it would be better if he had stay out of the process to avoid ani appear of improprieti he should not have particip in this decis in order to preserv the integr of the outcom vanc said how broad was ag session recus session formal statement say he decid to recus himself from ani exist or futur investig of ani matter relat in ani way to the campaign for presid a plain read of that statement would includ matter relat to the investig into former secretari of state hillari clinton use of a privat email server and probe of ani connect between the trump campaign and russia while session said he recus himself from matter that deal with the trump campaign the exact languag of that recus is in the press releas that exact languag is much broader than his remark refer onli to trump and typic the exact languag matter more than introductori remark session cite exist and futur investig one favor argument for doj would be that the clinton case was close and thus no longer an exist investig was this a selfrecus that session may simpli take back no court or higher author order this recus so there is an argument that session simpli chose to recus and might choos to withdraw his recus or take it back he did announc the recus howev as a product of doj career offici advis that he should recus under rule which state prosecutor may have a conflict of interest when they have a polit relationship with a potenti target giller analysi is that session written statement was a legal oper document and anyth he say oral doesnt undo the legal consequ of what he said he would do ok are there ani consequ if session did violat his recus for now no legal expert note a typic recus violat can result in consequ rang from disciplin to dismiss and can be investig by the doj intern watchdog but this situat is rather distinct sinc the ag recus himself and the issu is a personnel decis not an actual case legal expert say the onli potenti legal consequ that may aris would be in hypothet futur litig for exampl a parti alleg harm from session action could rais the issu befor a judg in a case if a prosecut grew out of these issu someon would need legal stand to challeng session role and that person would thus need to be a target or indict individu vanc the former prosecutor note this is a uniqu situat nobodi know what the legal remedi is becaus we are in unchart territori some part of prosecutori misconduct would have to be alleg in a crimin indict she said ad but ive never seen this
