that year thensen major leader harri reid dnev tri to proceed to consid again a fail vote to end debat on the millett nomin for the dc circuit that motion was nondebat so the gop couldnt stop him so the senat vote to make the fail vote the busi at hand befor the senat at that point reid made a point of order that the vote requir to break a filibust on all nomin other than for the suprem court of the unit state state is by major vote the presid offic a democrat rule against reid this was prebak after all that was the old preced so reid then appeal the chair rule that forc the senat to vote on what the chair rule a simpl major wasnt valid to end filibust on execut branch nomine just a supermajor #

what democrat dont get about trump work class base held in the middl of one of the most tumultu era of american polit the # new york mayor elect mark an import turn point in our histori the handsom john lindsay a progress republican at a time when the parti had their fair share of liber manag to etch out a victori against futur mayor abraham beam a typic tammi hall democrat lindsay would go on to serv two term as mayor befor watch his polit career falter but he may not have becom mayor at all were it not for one man william f buckley while the late conserv intellectu is now better known for his philosoph contribut to the american right he had a briefbut significantcar as a politician buckley knew that he wouldnt win the elect that wasnt whi he was run in realiti the onli real motiv for buckley was that he didnt want to see a liber republican like lindsay do well lest john lindsay becom a central figur in the gop and set back the young but burgeon conserv movement but while buckley may have hope to stop lindsay by chip off republicanlean millionair his strongest support actual came from ethnic white or what wed now call the white work class in contrast lindsay an uppereast sider and a quintessenti member of the liber elit won by drive up the score with margin popul that saw a champion in him throughout his mayoralti lindsay would fight for the right of africanamerican latino and even the lgbtq communiti earn their supporta well as the disdain of the white work class fiftytwo year later the polit of # new york remain astound relev while the white work class may not have had the polit capit to even come close to elect buckley it was bare abl to elect donald trump but trump was mere the capston of white work class support for the gop for the first time in decadesand probabl in all of american historyth white ethnic work class is the cornerston the central bloc of the republican parti vote base this has understand stun liber partial becaus such voter form a critic bloc of the democrat parti as recent as thirti year ago but it also becaus from a liber perspect the democrat parti should be the natur home of the white work class after all the democrat parti is the one that stand up to big busi the democrat parti is the one that stand up for medicar and other entitl program the democrat parti is the one that reject generous tax break for the # the democrat parti is the one that stand up for the workingman and yet the democrat parti seem unabl to earn the support of the veri peopl it claim to champion whi opinion vari the establish wing of the parti eg nanci pelosi seth moulton the crook team believ that the democrat parti neednt make ani polici chang they say that the parti alreadi has polici to support these voter in place and that the real problem come from a failur to communic them the progress wing eg berni sander elizabeth warren keith ellison say that the problem is systemat that the parti is not with work peopl and must move further to the left to earn their support and then of cours there are your thoma frank who more or less say that the real problem is that work class citizen have been brainwash into support republican by way of the cultur war each diagnos is compel and persuas but also fundament wrong head the problem is that everi pundit who hold these view has forgotten a fundament rule of anthropolog research and the entir american work class is so foreign to jon lovett that we should call it anthropolog relativ each and everi one of them ask how could these peopl who would so clear benefit from democrat polici vote republican what could possibl lead them to do such a thing as a result they more or less tri to figur out what might lead them to support republican if they were in the white work classs shoe seem without consid the possibl that the white work class view the world and it problem in a complet differ way but the problem is that they do see the world a differ way they see most problem and solut differ which ultim render a lot of propos solut polit worthless take trump budget propos as an exampl look at it from a polici perspect the plan is abysm and would do noth to make america great the

as is im guess that it the kind of budget that trump base were hope hed introduc trump support tend to be skeptic of humancaus climat chang and ani regulatori solut to the issu this is probabl becaus mani voter believ these solut do littl more than elimin good job for bluecollar worker so a cutback on the epa not onli reduc frivol spend it creat job the nea anoth exampl of wast govern spend that take taxdollar from the hardwork and give it to someth worthless the state depart you cant defeat isi with word and those welfar program all they do is subsid undeserv idler at the expens of the workingman yet anoth exampl of how the govern is corrupt and has to be drain and those goldman sach banker riddl among his cabinet it seem that support dont realli blame the wealthi for our problem even if his campaign rhetor would seem to suggest otherwis in their mind busi are privat creat job and are therefor respons to no one but themselv and their stockhold whi els would they have trust a businessman enough to elect him instead mani of them feel that the primari fault for the great recess lay with the govern who take their money and then squander it it import to note that this doesnt mean their view are necessarili in line with the mainstream republican parti they just think that the way the govern current spend is wast not all govern spend per se see medicar they do feel that the wealthi should pay more tax but not as strong as they feel they themselv should pay fewer they also tend to believ that higher spend on school is okay so long as none of that extra pay goe to teacher i could go on and on but my point is this trump support see the world veri differ they do practic ident polit and they think that someon is eat their share of the pie they do support big govern program but onli to the extent that these program help themselv not everyon els in their mind they earn their right to medicar and social secur but no one earn the right to healthcar simpli by be aliv they think the problem of the work poor simpli come from the fact that they arent will to work and theyd be fine if they got job addit there a real resent from work class american toward wealthier american when i say wealthi im not refer to lloyd blankfein or the koch brother im talk about peopl who come from affluent communiti like san jose or schaumburg while most of these american think of themselv as middleclass most of their fellow citizen would probabl disagre the resid in these area domin the polit convers mean that befor trump a disproportion amount of the polit convers was focus on the concern of the wealthiest # percent of american meanwhil mani white work class member felt that their opinion and concern were not onli ignor but were conscious disregard and mock by the elit and if were be honest it true whenev the elit do come up with solut they say are suppos to benefit the work class theyr thought up without ani input from the veri peopl theyr suppos to help some of the worst place to be poor or middl class in this countri are also the most liber onli some of this is due to polici though it usual when democrat refus to close down public school in wealthi neighborhood instead of poor but it give the republican parti some outstand sell point about how the democrat cant run a govern mani liber like to view themselv as champion for the work class but mani work class citizen from all background seem to disagre and as someon who work in a warehous that employ a lot of minor i can confirm that these view are not exclus to the white work class while white work class and minor may not agre on issu like trade or polic reform they arent far apart on issu like transgend right abort militari intervent or welfar queen ive person heard minor member of the work class complain about how peopl on welfar have better live than they do ive often wonder how larg a coalit a trumplik candid without his racial dog whistl and conspiraci theori could form it may sound weird that these are the sentiment held by the white work class but in the context of histori it realli isnt all that strang while mani like to think of the # as the triumph of progressiv in the us and in a sens it was a lot of white work class voter never complet bought into it throughout the depress the war and beyond southern voter kept send conserv blue dog democrat like joe robinson and john garner to washington and these men alway found their way into import leadership posit onc there they were fair progress on women right but that about it these men and they were all men are whi we didnt establish a nation health care servic in the # and whi it took until the # to desegreg they fought the creation of a univers welfar state and they oppos the # immigr and nation act they resist most aspect of the new deal and form an integr part of the inform conserv coalit work class voter turn to a candid like trump is not an aberr it a return to normal im not write ani of this to critic or prais the work class and im certain not propos that the democrat parti creat a platform that cater complet to the work classs sentiment while i sympath with some work class resent my own view are general somewher to the left of barack obama and right of berni sander but i am argu that a lot of democrat are talk about the work class without talk to them mean that they dont get what they want or valu if the folk on pod save america want to talk about the work class and what they want mayb they should stop make assumpt and do some homework

is democrat socialist of america the futur of the left instead of rehash debat on berni or clinton or whatev other leader id rather focus on the state of progress organ at the grassroot that can ideal produc the polit strength to elect whatev leader we want in the futureand the mass organ to build real chang so im go to focus in this post on the democrat socialist of america dsa which i rejoin last decemb after mani year and i final made a branch meet last wednesday and id say the futur look bright if that meet is ani indic dsas explos growth dsa has had explos growth over the last year attain a membership of # nation as announc at the branch meet someth like four time the membership of just a year or so earlier that number was announc as larger than ani explicit socialist organ has had sinc the # sound about right given the implos of the left into the swamp of tini sect in the wake of the breakup of the origin socialist parti and the meltdown of student for a democrat societi and other larg left current after # dsa itself is the lineal descend of deb origin socialist parti and had some presenc on the left in the # and earli # but had becom far less vibrant with what seem most a paper membership in recent decad what has been most impress about dsa in the last year is not just peopl symbol sign up and pay membership due but the activ expans of new chapter in town and citi across the countri part the organ benefit from alli with the berni sander movement dure # but also continu membership and chapter growth postelect as peopl look for a group to do work within dure the trump resist period a group where i would put myself in new york citi this has meant the expans of new work group and chapter outsid it tradit meet in brooklyn the largest be a new chapter for uptown manhattan and the bronx which has now held four month membership meet multiissu multiraci organ as a goal the meet i attend this past wednesday reflect smart energet organ with rough # peopl pack into a room in the bronx the folk run the meet had the right mix of take the enterpris serious while not take themselv too serious with much of the focus on introduc the organ as well as the campaign dsa member were work on throughout the citi the list was impress includ support for strike worker work to close riker island support the climat chang march work to build immigr right solidar in neighborhood against ice raid and other issu work on hous socialist femin elector work and polit educ while much of that dsa action is by natur work with and through alreadi exist group focus on those issu the point of a share organ that can identifi key event and organ to work with for those commit alreadi to multiissu work is an obvious servic the polit educ and discuss group are also there to deepen the whi act and provid discuss of strategi that mani left activist are obvious thirsti to engag with more import dsa argu that work on multipl issu especi those impact communiti of color is the first step in build a more effect multiraci organ in it most recent # strategi document dsa is quit honest in admit it has been made up disproportion of white particular male activist so it make it a prioriti to build deeper tie with organ repres poor and workingclass women and peopl of color and by devot signific organiz resourc to educ our member about the import of antiracist organ build social and organ allianc dsa seem relat light on the impuls to project socialist propaganda onto the group and individu they work with outsid the organ but obvious see this engag in divers communiti as the best way to recruit new member to the organ and promot socialist polit in an ideal increas multiraci organ through that engag still it a healthi posit that the organ argu dsas role in build progress social movement is essenti to our work regardless of what we gain as an organ from this work it is an end in itself howev the meet i attend did emphas membership recruit both think about how to have new peopl sign up but also how to mobil the paper membership to do more whether through oneonon meet with design mobil or through host polit educ gettogeth in local home throughout the citi the aspir to membership growth goe handinhand with a serious hope of eventu build up the critic mass of socialistori activist where we can talk serious about the transit to democrat social through reform that fundament undermin the power of the capitalist system dsa argu that work on multipl issu especi those impact communiti of color is the first step in build a more effect multiraci organ if there is anyth miss in dsas offici strategi document and in the discuss of goal at the meet i attend although it was just one meet it the role dsa could hope to play in what could be call popular front facilit progress build endless coalit but few that realli develop longterm allianc that can execut multiyear strategi especi strategi that extend beyond singl issu most organiz allianc today are base on foundationfund pressuresdemand more than organ determin strategi push by mass membership but back in the # irv howe one of the founder of the dsaalign dissent magazin advoc in his book social and america reviv # popular front allianc minus the sometim antidemocrat role of the communist parti where leftist and more liber group would come togeth to promot longerterm strategi for social chang precis becaus dsa is build a larg membership work in multipl issu area and with multipl organ it can aspir as it grow to help push progress organ to work more close togeth not base on control the purs string as foundat do but by have critic mass of member and activist do so from within multipl group and to the extent that progress organiz leader come to share membership in dsa or have sympathi with it polit dsa could help promot those kind of strateg discuss both among local organ where chapter are locat and among nation leader where possibl a few quibbl with the branch meet if i had a critic of the dsa branch meet it was the attempt to insert an educ speaker in the middl of the organ meet in this case a talk on environment justic and social while i understand the goal of keep a focus on idea in the middl of the busi of the meet it hard to do a talk at a general meet that is not either too basic for some experienc folk or too esoter for other i general think left educ is better done at separ meet or possibl as an option addon onc the busi part of the meet is done and i do think formal debat where the focus is on activ intellectu or strateg differ is more engag for such a meet than a standalon singl speaker in general id rather have seen that time use for breakout session to plan specif work sinc while there were signup sheet for all the differ chapter work announc im a great believ in have anyon show up at a meet leav with a specif task to do there could easili be short work session built around some of the issu work group or around even more local neighborhood focus outreach includ all of the bronx and northern manhattan in a singl branch still mean it cover over two million peopl so eventu if success the branch will need to break up into multipl even more local chapter i had to travel # minut on multipl train to get to this meet so i look forward to when there is a washington height chapter onli a quick bike ride away from my own home look toward the futur but those small quibbl asid the meet was vibrant with lot of differ peopl take leadership role and clear energi to get thing done and even better the meet end with everyon migrat to anoth room with music and a free bar where peopl could drink and talk it is no small thing to have a membership organ of # avow democrat socialist grow rapid across the countri if it can grow anoth order of magnitud and better expand it intern racial divers dsa could easili becom one of the key organiz vehicl where activist across the countri can debat key issu and promot a share strategi for radic chang i had origin hope that the sander campaign would build that vehicl think dsas day had pass but dsa smart took advantag of the sander upsurg to revit itself and with the sanderscr our revolut organ lack intern democrat structur dsa has end up the onli nation structur where individu activist actual can have a voic and a vote for leadership in a larg socialistori organ along the line of sandersstyl polit with a bit more recognit than sander himself that antirac polit must be a more central part of ani socialistori platform that individu vote by member control the organ is no small thing there realli are veri few multiissu nation organ socialist or not work on such a wide varieti of issu where the leadership is elect by the membership labor union do this to a certain extent but you cant walk off the street and join if there isnt one in your workplac that lack be a sad realiti for most of the popul there are a few vener organ like the naacp and the sierra club with real membership and an elect board of director but nation membershipcontrol organ are surpris scarc on the progress landscap so dsa be a place where anyon can pay their due and have a vote on it leadership and it organiz direct give it a most uniqu role in the current progress array of nation organ more than #

you arent the boss your the apprentic you are the oldest person ever elect presid and the onli one with no government experi of ani kind either in elect offic or in the militari there are peopl in the room who can actual help you if you let them yes you were elect in part becaus you sold the notion that ignor of the system is a virtu that what we all said as colleg kid in the # but that cant and wont work in the oval offic # you are not ronald reagan the gipper was a master of use tv to go over the head of congress in the earli # use his forc yet genial person to put public pressur on lawmak but those were the day of reagan democrat and reagan appeal had a bipartisan effect you have no purchas whatsoev with democrat today and veri littl at the moment with independ you can firm up the gop base but that is alreadi #

yes mr presid health care is complic now what are you go to do about it nobodi knew health care could be so complic that was presid donald trump speak at the white hous monday and if anyth can encapsul the dilemma face republican as they halt tri to keep their campaign promis to repeal and replac the afford care act aka obamacar it that the idea that nobodi knew health care is complic is of cours nonsens as liter anyon whos ever visit a doctor or use health insur could tell you but the realiz seem to have come belat to trump perhap trump will use his address befor a joint session of congress tuesday to lay out a detail plan for how to remak the health care system but the presid own shift and contradictori statement about health care reform suggest that he remain unclear about what to do and how much ownership to take of the consequ of repeal the afford care act at a recent meet with ohio gov john kasich r for exampl trump seem to be sway by appeal to keep much of the law coverag expans in place the governor drew chart on piec of paper on the presid desk outlin the potenti cost of repeal an aid familiar with the exchang told the huffington post he respond veri posit to a number of the idea i had kasich who use the afford care act to expand medicaid said on cbs news face the nation sunday trump went over the chart three separ time and even got his newli instal health and human servic secretari tom price on the phone to discuss it further accord to the aid other aid had to remind the presid that the congression republican plan are far less generous after which trump express prefer for kasich approach as the washington post report at a separ meet with a bipartisan group of governor meanwhil trump larg punt on detail for his health care plan when press by attende a sourc familiar with the session who was not author to speak public about it told huffpost but when price said that there would be a replac plan in place about four week after repeal was enact trump did chime in say it need to be done in two or three week hous speaker paul ryan rwis and senat major leader mitch mcconnel rki seem to have a better sens of where they want to go with repeal perhap becaus they especi ryan have spent more time focus on the issu but these congression leader havent been abl to bridg the divid in their own skittish caucus about the time or scope of the repeal and replac effort meanwhil there has been a groundswel of anger over the prospect of kill the increas popular law ryan appear desper enough to advanc afford care act repeal that hes consid push legisl to the floor and essenti dare reluct and unsatisfi member to vote against it the wall street journal report the bet is that few republican would pass up a chanc to damag the afford care act lest their support see them break their promis to do so this trial balloon didnt soar long on monday rep mark meadow rnc who chair the conserv hous freedom caucus said that he would vote against a forthcom gop leadership propos if like a version that leak to politico last week it still had element of an entitl program that underscor republican riski bid addit legisl would have to be on record call for million of peopl to lose health care with no guarante that the senat would follow suit or that congress as a whole would eventu come up with someth better than the afford care act aud guerrucciafpgetti imag presid donald trump met with execut from larg health insur compani at the white hous on monday this disarray is new although in hindsight it was to be expect in the year sinc democrat in congress and thenpresid barack obama began put togeth the afford care act and work to implement it republican have had the luxuri of sit in the backseat critic the law and talk about how much better they could do now theyr in the driver seat and they cant even agre on a destin much less a rout to get there republican are tri to squar their promis to as trump put it offer great health care that much less expens and much better while still elimin the tax on wealthi peopl and health care compani that pretti much imposs becaus those tax pay for about half of what the afford care act doe and there no enthusiasm for altern way to rais the money republican also cant squar their promis of great health care with the parti ideolog commit to smaller govern sinc without regul insur will offer polici that cover fewer servic and offer even less financi protect and without generous govern subsidi poor peopl and mani middleclass peopl wont have enough money to buy coverag that draft legisl that leak to politico make clear how leader intend to resolv the inconsist in their rhetor they would weaken protect for peopl with preexist condit and dramat slash feder spend on health care for the poor and the middl class while propos a new tax on the jobbas health benefit plan that cover the major of american the result would be mani more peopl without insur and much greater exposur to medic bill for those who have coverag accord to an analysi of the plan that axio and vox obtain this approach isnt surpris ryan philosoph idol is the objectivist writer ayn rand and he believ that high taxat of the wealthi is moral wrong and that the govern should provid far less help to the indig than it current doe mcconnel has a more flexibl ideolog but hes never had much of an appetit for preserv big govern program when he can kill them instead the white hous though is anoth stori trump certain isnt an orthodox conserv and hes bare a republican in the tradit sens on the one hand trump chose price an ideolog conserv to be secretari of health and human servic and at various point dure his candidaci and the presidenti transit he embrac reform consist with ryan on the other hand trump also keep pledg insur for everybodi a pledg utter inconsist with ryan and price propos and with decad of gop health care polici the simplest explan for the inconsist is ignor trump doesnt realli understand the tradeoff of health polici and cant be bother to learn his comment at the white hous monday support that theori but it also possibl that trump has genuin mix feel the abstract notion of snatch away health coverag from million of poor and workingclass famili may not troubl the presid sleep but some of those folk are his voter and theyr grow increas worri that when republican promis to repeal obamacar it meant their obamacar too we also know that trump advis are divid as the washington post report over the weekend vice presid mike penc and other are urg the presid to forg ahead with repeal but chief strategist steve bannon senior polici advis stephen miller presidenti soninlaw jare kushner whose brother run a health insur compani and nation econom council chairman gari cohn dont want the presid mire in the health care mess accord to the report this is the dawn realiz that repeal is polit riskier than gop lawmak allow themselv to acknowledg dure the past eight year the health care fight is also suck up time and polit capit creat higher hurdl for trump and the gop to advanc the rest of their agenda includ tax cut for the rich and infrastructur spend the question is whether at some point trump decid to steer this debat in one direct or the other he may not he may just remain handsoff or continu to send conflict signal but at some point the fate of reform may hang on his action whether it give up lobbi legisl or ultim sign a bill in other word he cant duck the choic forev and so it will be interest to see whether on tuesday night trump decid to start weigh in more forc like the man said it complic sam stein contribut report
